# This is a memory-based pattern game featuring four colored buttons. The computer generates a sequence by lighting up colors one at a time, and the player must repeat the entire sequence from the beginning in the correct order. With each successful round, the computer adds one more color to the sequence, making it progressively longer and more challenging. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, testing memory retention and concentration skills.
